This repository contains my solutions to Python exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), a platform for practicing and improving coding skills through interactive exercises.

## üìö About

The exercises in this repository demonstrate various Python programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. They are designed to help:

- Master Python programming fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Learn best practices, coding standards, and idiomatic Python
- Develop algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews and real-world programming challenges

All solutions follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guidelines and include appropriate documentation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

Each exercise is contained in its own directory with a consistent structure:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- pytest (for running tests)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/exercism-python-solutions.git
   cd exercism-python-solutions
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

### Running Solutions

You can run any solution directly:
```bash
python exercise_name/exercise_name.py
```

### Running Tests

To verify a solution against the test cases:
```bash
# Run tests for a specific exercise
pytest exercise_name/exercise_name_test.py

# Run all tests
pytest
```

## üìù Learning Points

Each solution demonstrates one or more of the following Python concepts:

- Clean, readable code following Python idioms
- Effective use of data structures and algorithms
- Proper error handling and input validation
