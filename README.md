# Exercism Python Exercises

This repository contains solutions to Python exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), a platform for practicing and improving coding skills through interactive exercises.

## About

The exercises in this repository are designed to help you:
- Improve your Python programming skills.
- Learn best practices and coding standards.
- Solve real-world problems using Python.

Each exercise focuses on a specific concept or problem, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The solutions are written with clarity and maintainability in mind, following Python's best practices.

## Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each representing a specific exercise or topic. For example:
- `arcade_game/`: Functions implementing rules for a classic arcade game.
- `conditionals/`: Functions for implementing basic control statements.
- `exchange/`: Functions for calculating currency exchange values.
- `lasagna/`: Functions for calculating preparation and baking times for lasagna.
- `leap/`: Function to determine whether a given year is a leap year.
- `triangle/`: Functions validating different triangle type logic.
- `grains/`: Functions calculating the number of grains on a specific square of the chessboard.
- `armstrong_numbers/`: Function to determine if a number is an Armstrong number.
- `collatz_conjecture/`: Function to calculate the number of steps to reach 1 using the Collatz Conjecture.
- `bob/`: Function to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him.
- `raindrops/`: Function solving a slightly more complex version of FizzBuzz, a classic interview question.
- `pig_latin/`: Function to translate text from English to Pig Latin.
- `perfect_number/`: Function to classify a number as perfect, abundant, or deficient.
- `black_jack/`: Functions implementing some rules of Blackjack, such as the way the game is played and scored.
- `darts/`: Function to calculate the points scored in a single toss of a Darts game.
- `strings/`: Functions to perform basic string operations like searching, cleaning, splitting, transforming, and translating.
- `lists/`: Functions to perform basic list operations, such as concatenation, filtering, and averaging.
- `sublist/`: Functions to determine the relationship between two lists (e.g., sublist, superlist, equal, or unequal).
- `resistor_color/`: Functions to convert resistor colors to their numerical values.
- `resistor_color_duo/`: Function to calculate the resistance value of a resistor based on the first two color bands.
- `resistor_color_trio/`: Function to calculate the resistance value of a resistor based on three color bands.
- `resistor_color_expert/`: Function to calculate the resistance value and tolerance of a resistor based on its color bands.
- `all_your_base/`: Function to convert a sequence of digits in one base to another base.

Each subdirectory contains:
- A Python file with the solution.
- A corresponding test file (if applicable) to validate the solution.

## Getting Started

To run the exercises locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/exercism_py.git
   cd exercism_py
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher is recommended). You can check your Python version with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. Run the Python scripts directly or use the test files to validate the solutions:
   ```bash
   python path/to/exercise.py
   ```

4. (Optional) Run tests using `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
